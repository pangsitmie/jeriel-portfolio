                <h3>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</h3>
                <p>During my internship period I realize that our company's website was not desgined & developed properly. So after I've finished my tasks
                    I took an initiative to redesign this website from scratch and make it more user friendly.
                    <br />
                    I've used React.js as the main framework and I've used Figma for the UI design.
